# Tyler's Project List:

## [Property Rental Pricing](https://github.com/tylerxiety/rentalpricing)
The project is to find the right rental strategies to maximise revenues for property owners in Melbourne. 
This breaks down into formulating and solving regression, classification, and optimisation problems based on 
rental scenarios. The solution is a web app with optimisation APIs and models pre-trained on 27 million 
records of rental listings.

## [Smart Pricing for Petrol Stations](https://smart-pricing.herokuapp.com/smart-pricing-input)
The objective was to find the right pricing strategies for a petrol station chain to maximise revenue, 
in a team of 4 data scientists. This breaks down into training machine learning models on 25 million 
transaction records and solving optimisation problems based on store policies. The solution was a web 
app with optimisation and model APIs.
