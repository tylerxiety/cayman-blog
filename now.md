This is a Now List, inspired by [(the /now page movement)](https://sivers.org/nowff)的启发。

>It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. 
>
>A public declaration of priorities.

A Now List is a todo list and a list of goals. 

If I find myself doing something that is not on the list. Should I add it or stop?
