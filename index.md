# Tyler's Project List:

## [Smart Pricing for Petrol Stations](https://smart-pricing.herokuapp.com/smart-pricing-input)
The project is to build a pricing engine that recommends the right pricing strategies for a petrol station chain to achieve the best business outcomes. 
The pricing engine uses machine learning and optimisation algorithms to do the magic. This is a proof of concept done by a team of 4 data scientists. 

See the [demo page here](https://smart-pricing.herokuapp.com/smart-pricing-input).

## [Property Rental Pricing](https://github.com/tylerxiety/rentalpricing)
The project is to find the right rental strategies to maximise revenues for property owners in Melbourne. 
This breaks down into formulating and solving regression, classification, and optimisation problems based on 
rental scenarios. The solution is a web app with optimisation APIs and models pre-trained on 27 million 
records of rental listings.
